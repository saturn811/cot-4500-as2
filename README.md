Assignment 2 covers chapters 3 and 4. Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a given data set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the dataset.This can help us by approximating points on complicated curves. However, this requires tons of operations on different points along the curve and introduces matrix operations.
